# Data.gov-Chatbot

## Project Description:

This is a Python-based application using the FastAPI framework to
download datasets in CSV format from Data.gov and implement a chat API that responds to
user queries related to the downloaded data. Additionally, a free OpenAI API key is set up
to incorporate natural language processing capabilities into the chatbot.

## Key Components:

### Data Downloader Module:
* Develop a module to connect to the Data.gov API and download datasets in CSV format.
* Allow users to specify search parameters (e.g., keywords, data formats) for targeted
downloads.
* Implement error handling and logging to capture download activities.

### FastAPI Integration:
* Utilize FastAPI to create a RESTful API that serves as the backend for the project.
* Create API endpoints for downloading datasets and retrieving information about
downloaded datasets.

### OpenAI Chatbot:
* Sign up for a free OpenAI API key to access the GPT-based language model.
* Implement a chatbot module that uses the OpenAI API to respond to user queries
related to the downloaded datasets.

### Enhanced Logging:
* Implement a robust logging system using Python&#39;s logging module to capture events,
errors, and activities within the application.
* Log critical information such as API requests, download status, and chatbot interactions.

## Deliverables:

### Data Downloader Application:
* Python application capable of downloading datasets from Data.gov based on user-specified criteria:

### FastAPI Backend:
* FastAPI-based RESTful API with endpoints for data download and dataset information retrieval.

### OpenAI Chatbot:
* Chatbot module integrated with the OpenAI API key to respond to user queries about downloaded datasets.

### Logging System
* Enhanced logging functionality capturing critical events and activities in the application.


### Tech Stack:

* Python
* FastAPI
* OpenAI API (GPT-based)
* Logging module for enhanced logging
